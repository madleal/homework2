<h2>Boston Massachusetts, 2010: The word Confident in Greek</h2>
<p>This was my first tattoo.  I went to visit a friend in Boston and we were exploring the Harvard campus.  Upon taking a small detour my friend mentioend she was interested in getting her next tattoo.  I told her that I had been considering getting my first tattoo and already had something in mind.  As we were climbing up the escalators "Chameleon Tattoo" greeted us at the top.  As if by faith we both looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>I got the word Confident in Greek for two reason.  One, I wanted a constant reminder to always be confident.  That year I had was going through really hard times. Personally I was struggling to remain confident in myself.  Two, Greek mythology fascinated me and I had studied Greek art history in high school.  I always admired Greek society and found them to be resilient. </p> 

<p>Confident for me means to believe and love thyself.</p>

<h2>Hawaii, 2011: Chameleon</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2011 I took a spontaneous trip to Oahu Hawaii with some of my close college friends.  The trip itself was one of my favorite girls trip and was filled with a lot of love and laugh out loud moments.  I was getting out of a dark period in my life and this trip was a reminder that life is too short to be spent crying over things I couldn't change.  I was discovering that I was an adaptable being and the thing I loved most about myself is my ability to blend in or stand out. </p>

<p>The Chameleon often takes the form and color of its environment.  But I also associate chameleons to be colorful symbols and adaptation.  I adapt but I also stand out.  So came my idea of getting a chameleon tattoo. </p>

<h2>Seatlle Washington, 2013: Feather with the world Travel</h2>
<p>Ever taken a girls trip with your bestie on Valentines day?  I have.  On the eve of Valentines day one of my bestfriends from high school and I took a trip to Seattle.  It was something that we'd had always wanted to do. This trip was one of my favorite trips.  I decided that I wanted something to remind me of the one time that Nicole and I went to Seattle and spent the majority of our time laughing at our silly selves.  I remember laughing so much that our stomachs ached from all the laughter.</p>

<p>The feather tattoo I got reminds me of the time that we went to Seattle. I had the word travel written underneath it to remind me to always remember to travel to different places.  I want to live a life of adventure and traveling fun.  I think I've been doing just that.</p>

<h2>Hanoi Vietnam, 2015: Elephant Tattoo</h2>
<p>Spring 2015 I had the opportunity to travel to Hanoi Vietnam.  It was my first time I had to travel on a plane for 14 hours.  I had been to Mexico before, but this was the first time I had to cross the great vast ocean.  Vietnam for me was a beautiful adventure.  I got lost in the city and ventured solo. I got an elephant tatoo for nothing more than for luck.</p>
